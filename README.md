# How to use

Fisrt check your settings page, it should looks like below:

By the way, my desktop resolution is 1920x1080, so if you could just use the resolutionðŸ‘ˆ

**NOTICE: DO NOT MODIFY GAME RESOLUTION WHEN CODE RUNNING**

## Steps

1. install requirements, I forgot to add a list or requirements.txt, anyway, just get the point.

2. run the py file as admin, I guess it would be fine if you install requirements properly.

3. go to the fishing area and click twice button, script would help you press â¬†â¬†â¬‡â¬‡â¬…â¬…âž¡âž¡ (only this! do not expect more.)

4. I guess nothing.

5. fork and modify code as you like, I rarely read issues.
