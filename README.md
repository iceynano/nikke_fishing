# How to use

**ONLY PC** ~~of course you can get mobile version, just boring modification~~

Fisrt check your settings page, it should looks like below: (just screen mode and graphic ratio!)

By the way, my desktop resolution is 1920x1080, so if you could just use the resolutionðŸ‘ˆ

now script support other resolution, but **1080p** and settings below is still better.

**NOTICE: DO NOT MODIFY GAME RESOLUTION WHEN CODE RUNNING**

## Steps

1. if you want install manually, just running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. (if you use venv or other virtual env, I bet you are good at this)  

    if you use release package, just unzip it then double click `start script.bat`, it would auto install requirements to folder under script.

2. run the py file **AS ADMIN** if you install manually, I guess it would be fine if you install requirements properly.

3. go to the fishing area and click twice button, script would help you press â¬†â¬†â¬‡â¬‡â¬…â¬…âž¡âž¡ (assist mode), now you can also choose to wipe out fishing spot with SL (semi-automatic mode).

4. you could just keep code running when in game, it would only press button when fishing game running, but remember quit script if you do not use it.

5. I guess nothing.

6. If you find code runs badly, I have left extra funcs in script, fork and modify code as you like, I rarely read issues.

7. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, if you got banned, I would be glad to advise you play games that don't constrain the use of scripts. 

**NOTICE: KEEP GAME RUNNING FOREGROUND AND WINDOW NO OBSTRUCTED WHEN YOU WANT IT FISHING**
